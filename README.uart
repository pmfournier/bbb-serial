The BBB has 5 UARTs

UART0 is used for the console via connector J1
UART3 is transmit-only

In order to be used, must load the device tree overlay. RTS/CTS support seems
to be optional depending on the device tree overlay used.

Example for UART1:
pins: RX P9_26, TX P9_24, CTS P9_20, RTS P9_19
echo BB-UART1 >/sys/devices/bone_capemgr.9/slots
# UART can then be accessed at /dev/ttyO1
